Hello, I really glad that you spend time to read my little game project. My purpose when I made this toward learning React as well as improving my Javascript.
So. What is this? It's a simple game that I build when learning React on Freecodecamp, with original name is Tenzies but
instead of playing with the numbers I changed it to Pokemons icon and named it to Tenzies Pokemon, added some features to reduce boringness ,it's constist of:
** Add icon to each dice
** Track the number of rolls
** Track the time it took to win
** Best record is saved to localStorage
** Buttons to reset record, renew the game
